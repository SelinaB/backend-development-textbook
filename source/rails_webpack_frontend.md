## Frontend Pipelines

When the rails asset pipeline was published with rails 3.1 in 2011, node.js
was only 2 years old. Version 1.0 of npm, the node package manager, was released at the
same time as the asset pipeline.

In the years since, the frontend community developed, released (and dropped) many
new tools: bower, grunt, gulp, yarn, webpacker.

Since Rails 5.1 webpacker is an official part of Rails. It coexists with the asset pipeline.
The primary purpose for webpack is app-like JavaScript. You can still use
the asset pipeline for images, CSS, or even small JavaScript "sprinkles" to use in server generated html.
