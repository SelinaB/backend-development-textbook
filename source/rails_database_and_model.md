Rails: Database and Models
==========================

Models are the basic Classes of a Rails Project.  The
data is actually stored in a relational database.

After working through this guide you should

* Understand how ActiveRecord works
* Understand what Database Migrations are
* Be able to create models with associations to other models
* Be able to write validations to check data before it is saved in a model

This chapter relies on two episodes of [Rails for Zombies](http://railsforzombies.org), 
a wonderful free online course by codeschool.com.

Models and Databases
--------------------

In a modern programming language like rails we represent 
things in the real world with objects. For example if you are
building a web application for project management, you will
have objects of classes Project, and WorkPackage, and User.

To save these objects permanently (often called "persistance") 
we use a relational Database,
in most cases Postgres or MySQL/MariaDB.

Here we hit on an old problem in computer science: storing
objects into a relational database does not work all that well.
This problem is called the 
[Object-relational impedance mismatch](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-relational_impedance_mismatch)
and has been discussed since the early 1980ies.

Today there exist several Design Patterns and Libraries for solving this.
The solution is called an Object Relational Mapper or ORM.

Two Patterns used in Rails for this problem are ActiveRecord and ObjectMapper, both first
described by Fowler in his 2003 book [Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture](http://martinfowler.com/books/eaa.html).
ActiveRecord is the default solution used in Rails, we will look into it in detail here.


ActiveRecord Basics
------------

Rails implements the Active Record pattern in a class called `ActiveRecord`.
All the '''models''' in a rails project inherit from `ActiveRecord`.


``` ruby
class Thing < ActiveRecord::Base
end
```

### The Mapping

A quick overview of how Objects and Database relate when using
ActiveRecord in Rails:

```
Database                           Ruby on Rails
---------------------------        --------------------------
table courses                      class Course 
  in the Database                    in file app/models/course.rb
one row in the table               one object of the class Course
an attibute in the table           a property of the object
SELECT * FROM courses WHERE id=7   Course.find(7)
```

Rails has several conventions regarding ActiveRecord and the database:

* The Model Class is written in first-letter-uppercase, and uses a singular noun: `Course`
* The table in the database is written in lowercase, and uses the plural of this noun: `courses`
* The table contains an integer attribute `id` as its primary key
* All the attributes from the database table will show up as properties of the model in rails automatically
* If there's an 1:n relationship between two models, the table on the "one" side will contain a foreign key like so:
   * table `users`  and table `phones`  (one user has many phones)
   * table `phones` contains `user_id` that references `users.id`
* If there's a n:m relationship between two models, there will be a join table  like so:
   * table `users`  and table `projects`  (one user has many projects, one project has many users)
   * table `projects_users` contains `user_id` and `project_id` (and nothing else)
   * there is no class in rails to represent the join table 

If you stick to these conventions building the web app will be very easy.  You 
can deviate from these conventions, but this takes some extra configuration and programming work.

Here is one scenario where deviating from the conventions might make sense:
You are building a rails app to replace an old php app, but you want to
keep using the same database. You can start with the models
in rails configured to fit with your old database, and then refactor and migrate towards
the rails conventions step by step.

### How to build a model

To build the first model and its corresponding database table,
you can use the scaffold generator.
You need to work on the command line using the command `rails`.  
(before rails 5 there was a second command `rake` but you don't need that any more.)

* `rails generate scaffold tweet status:string zombie:string`
   * This will generate a Model `Tweet` and a migration to create table `tweets`
* look at the migration that was generated in `db/migrate/*create_tweets.rb`
* you can edit the migration now - but not later!
* run the migration: `rails db:migrate`
   * this will run the appropriate `CREATE TABLE` statement in your database
* look at the model generated in `app/models/tweet.rb`
* add validations, associations to the model

### Database Migrations

During Development the database schema will change just as much as
the code will change. Changes to both are interdependent: if I push out
a code change to my fellow developers without the db schema changes,
they will not be able to use the code.

Rails offers "Database Migrations" to cope with this fact.

A "Migration" is a (small) change in the database schema. The change is
described in ruby and saved to a file in the folder `db/migrations`.
The files are identified by a timestamp and a uniq name, for example:

```
20131031100433_create_venues.rb  
20131031100442_create_events.rb  
20131031100501_add_venue_ref_to_events.rb
```

The first two of these migrations were generated by the scaffold,
the last one by `rails generate migration AddVenueRefToEvent`.

The scaffold creates a migration for creating a table:

``` Ruby
class CreateEvents < ActiveRecord::Migration
  def change
    create_table :events do |t|
      t.string :title
      t.text :description
      t.datetime :start_time
      t.datetime :stop_time
      t.boolean :free

      t.timestamps
    end
  end
end
```

Use `rails` to apply this migration to the existing database:

* `rails db:migrate`  # apply all open migrations
* `rails db:rollback` # roll back last migration

A word of warning:  you never, ever need to change a migration after
using and commiting it.  You only ever add new migrations!

### the model in the console

You can use the rails console to work with
the model interactively.  This is similar to the ruby console `irb`
but with your rails app already loaded. 
Any changes you make are really written
to the development database!

* `rails console`

Validations and Associations
------------

### Validations

Validations are rules you want to enforce on the data in your models.

* validations are declared on the model
* they are checked every time data is saved to the database
* if the data does not conform to the validation, it is not saved, and the errors are available through the object

An example on the rails console: I try to create a new tweet and save it,
but it can't be saved because a validation is in place:

``` ruby
> t = Tweet.new
=> #<Tweet id: nil, status: nil, zombie: nil>
> t.save
=> false
> t.errors
=> {:status=>["can't be blank"]}
> t.errors[:status]
=> "can't be blank"
```


### 1:n Associations

If you have used relational databases before you are probably familiar
with the different types of associations between database tables.  But even
if you have not, the first association is easy to understand:

```
One Zombie has many Tweets          One Tweet belongs to one Zombie

Zombie Ash  ----------------------- Tweet 'arg'
            \---------------------- Tweet 'aarrrrrgggh'
            \---------------------- Tweet 'aaaarrrrrrrrrgggh'

Zombie Sue ------------------------ Tweet 'gagaga'
```

How is this represented in database?

In the table `tweets` there is a column `zombie_id` which references `zombies.id`.
This column in `tweets` is called a "foreign key".

You can add this column using a migration `add_column    :tweets, :zombie_id, :integer`

How is this represented in the model?

* 1:n associations are declared in the model with `belongs_to` and `has_many`
* both directions are now available in the objects:
  * `t = Tweet.find(7); z = t.zombie`
  * `z = Zombie.find(1); z.tweets.each{ |t|  puts t.status }`

You should have the ruby and rails documentation available
on your computer at all times.  A handy tool for this on mac os x is
[Dash](http://kapeli.com/dash).  This is what a Rails Guide looks like in Dash:
